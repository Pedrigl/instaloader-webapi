# If the project exposes a session mount at /data/session, but no files are

# files. This is intentionally informational only â€” the container will continue
# to start so it can still be used without sessions.

IMPORTANT: no Instaloader session files found in the mounted folder /data/session.

If you want the app to use an existing Instaloader session (so it is "logged in"
and can fetch private stories), create/copy the session file(s) named like:

  session-<your_username>

into the project directory on your host at ./sessions (the compose mount),
for example:

  # run locally (on your host) from the project root to generate session files
  python instaloader/2FA_bypass/import_chrome_session.py

  # then copy any generated session-<username> files into ./sessions
  mkdir -p sessions
  cp session-* sessions/

Alternatively, run the import script inside a container or generate the session
using the upstream Instaloader CLI (eg. `instaloader -l <username>`). After
placing session files into ./sessions, restart the container so they are
imported at startup.

If you intentionally don't want sessions, you can ignore this message.
